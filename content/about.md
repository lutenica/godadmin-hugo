So who am I and what gives me the right to speak to you? My name is Lachezar and I am many things:

* A person in the so-called "IT" space.
* An avid cyclist.
* A beer drinking enthusiast.
* A gamer - who isn't nowadays?
* A person who likes to think about everything that sorounds us and discuss it with the wider world.
* I like to read and write.

This site is a collection of all of my thoughts on various topics, which is to say the site is quite oppinionated.

I also have a passion for documenting/sharing knowledge so in the [Tech](https://link_to_tech) section there will often be tutorials or break-downs of how my pet projects work (including this site itself and mywhole pipeline).

Note that as every person changes so too, should their blogs as they are not only archives of one's thoughts, but more like mirrors into what one is at a particular time. To use an analogy from IT (for once I get to do it this way around, rather than describing IT with things in the real world), each group of posts is a snapshot of a person's thinking. This can become stale as our cells age and die out and we start to change and hopefully even grow.

Technically it's not me speaking to you, but rather your own narrator. It's actually funny how I can make their voice **big and booomy** or *sarcastic and accusatory*. 

Putting pen to paper, or more accurately, fingers to keyboard, is my preferred way of sharing complex thoughts and ideas. It allows me to flesh them out and also describe what is going on in a more clear cut way.

If you'd like to get in touch I'm the process of figuring out a way to make that work, whilst avoiding spam, so stay tuned!

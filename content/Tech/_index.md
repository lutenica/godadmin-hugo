Oh boy, my favorite topic! Technology has interested me since I was very young, as I am sure it has a lot of people. My first real job was in IT and I still call that field home. Expect everything from tutorials, to break downs on how I've set things up, to my thoughts on some new gadget, PC hardware, or software - basically all things that make me either happy or very mad will be here.

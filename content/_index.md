Welcome to the place where I dump all of my thoughts for the world to see and hopefully read! 

It was high time I started a blog, so this is it. Broadly speaking I ramble on about [Tech](https://link_to_the_tech_category), [Cycling](https://link_to_cycling_category), [Philosophy](https://link_to_philosophy_category) and [other random](https://link_to_asdf) topics. Oh also, it will serve as a repository for various [cooking recipies](https://link_to_food) me and my partner have ammased over the years. Each topic has it's own deeper breakdown and tags. I hope that you enjoy your stay here! 

The voices in my head tell me that even though I may be the only real person reading this, they always have oppinions on what I have to say! Also, if you scream (or type as the case is here) into the void long enough maybe it starts writting back?
